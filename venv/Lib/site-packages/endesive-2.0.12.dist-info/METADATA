Description
===========

Python library for digital signing and verification of digital signatures in mail,
PDF and XML documents.

The ASN.1 implementation depends on `asn1crypto`_.
Cryptographic routines depends on `cryptography`_ library.

For certificate verification OpenSSL is used but I would not trust it,
next version should switch to `cryptography`_.

This library implements S/MIME handler which can encrypt and decrypt S/MIME messages
using a public RSA key, in AES-128/192/256 CBC/OFB modes.
It can also sign and verify S/MIME messages.

This library implements CAdES-B handler for signing and verifying PDF documents in
Adobe.PPKLite/adbe.pkcs7.detached form.
It can sign documents during generation using a modified version of `pyfpdf`_ which is
included in this library. It can also sign documents generated by external programms.

This library implements XADES BES/T  with enveloped and enveloping format for creating
signed xml files.

This library implements CMS handler for signing and verifying plain text files with
detached signature files.
